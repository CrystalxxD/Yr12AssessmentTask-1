**1. Discuss the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating responsive web pages. Explain the significance of asynchronous programming in improving web page load times and user experience.**\
HTML provides the structure of the webpage, CSS formats and styles the page to make it look better, and JavaScript adds interactive behaviours. HTML provides the base layout that can scale across screen sizes. CSS then modifies the look and layout using flexible units, grids and media queries, allowing the design to shift naturally between desktop, tablet and mobile. JavaScript ensures interactive elements remain functional and can change dynamically as the viewport changes. For example, a navigation system is structured with HTML, styled with CSS to shrink, expand, and collapse into a small menu. Imagine the webpage is a house, HTML is the frame, CSS is the interior design, and JavaScript is the electricity and water supply, moving parts, etc. A responsive house rearranges itself based on the number of people inside, like a webpage that adapts to personal preferences.

**2. Explain how a slow page loading can impact user engagement and suggest web programming techniques to improve it.**\
Slow page loading reduces user engagement because users become impatient and are more likely to leave before the page becomes usable. This leads to higher bounce rates and less time spent interacting with the site. Slow loading also creates a negative impression of the site’s reliability, which lowers trust and discourages return visits. Web programming techniques such as minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, compressing images, using lazy loading, and implementing asynchronous JavaScript can significantly improve loading speed. These techniques reduce file sizes, load critical content first, and allow background tasks to run without freezing the interface. As a result, pages feel faster and smoother, which increases user satisfaction and overall engagement.

**3. Explain two benefits of HTML and CSS in web development. Provide an example of how they work together to structure and style a webpage.**\
HTML and CSS provide essential benefits in web development because HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS controls its visual presentation and layout.
