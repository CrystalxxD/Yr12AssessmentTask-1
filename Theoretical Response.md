**1. Discuss the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating responsive web pages. Explain the significance of asynchronous programming in improving web page load times and user experience.**\
HTML provides the structure of the webpage, CSS formats and styles the page to make it look better, and JavaScript adds interactive behaviours. HTML provides the base layout that can scale across screen sizes. CSS then modifies the look and layout using flexible units, grids and media queries, allowing the design to shift naturally between desktop, tablet and mobile. JavaScript ensures interactive elements remain functional and can change dynamically as the viewport changes. For example, a navigation system is structured with HTML, styled with CSS to shrink, expand, and collapse into a small menu. Imagine the webpage is a house, HTML is the frame, CSS is the interior design, and JavaScript is the electricity and water supply, moving parts, etc. A responsive house rearranges itself based on the number of people inside, like a webpage that adapts to personal preferences.

**2. Explain how a slow page loading can impact user engagement and suggest web programming techniques to improve it.**\
Slow page loading reduces user engagement because users become impatient and are more likely to leave before the page becomes usable. This leads to higher bounce rates and less time spent interacting with the site. Slow loading also creates a negative impression of the site’s reliability, which lowers trust and discourages return visits. Web programming techniques such as minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, compressing images, using lazy loading, and implementing asynchronous JavaScript can significantly improve loading speed. These techniques reduce file sizes, load critical content first, and allow background tasks to run without freezing the interface. As a result, pages feel faster and smoother, which increases user satisfaction and overall engagement.

**3. Explain two benefits of HTML and CSS in web development. Provide an example of how they work together to structure and style a webpage.**\
HTML and CSS provide essential benefits in web development because HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS controls its visual presentation and layout. HTML makes development clearer and more organised by using semantic tags that define the purpose of content, such as headings, paragraphs and images. CSS improves efficiency by separating design from structure, allowing developers to adjust colours, spacing, typography and layout without altering the HTML itself. This separation leads to cleaner code, easier maintenance and faster styling changes across multiple pages. For example, HTML might be used to create a `<div>` containing a heading and a paragraph, while CSS targets those elements to style the heading with a larger font size and the paragraph with specific spacing and colour. This shows how HTML forms the foundation of the page and CSS enhances its appearance.

**4. Outline what is JavaScript and how it enhances the functionality of a webpage. Provide an example where JavaScript is used to validate user input on a web form.**\
JavaScript is a scripting language used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to webpages. It enhances functionality by allowing pages to respond to user actions, update content without reloading and handle tasks such as animations, form checks and menus.

An example is using JavaScript to validate a web form: when a user submits their details, a script can check whether the email field is filled in correctly or whether the password meets length requirements, displaying an alert if the input is invalid.

**5. Discuss the importance of optimising webpage load time for user experience. Provide three techniques to improve the loading speed of a website.**
Optimising web performance is essential because faster-loading websites improve user experience, reduce bounce rates, and increase engagement. Web developers can improve performance in several ways. Compression reduces the size of images, CSS and JavaScript files, allowing browsers to load content more quickly. Testing code ensures that scripts run efficiently and identifies slow functions using developer tools. Investing in server hardware ensures the site can handle multiple requests simultaneously, preventing delays caused by overloaded or underpowered servers. For example, an online store that compresses product images and minifies JavaScript will load faster for users, while developer tools can reveal which scripts are slowing the page. Hosting the site on high-performance servers ensures that even during peak traffic, pages remain responsive. This is like comparing two cafes: one has a slow barista and cramped space, causing long waits, while the other has a fast, efficient barista and enough tables for everyone. Customers stay longer and enjoy the experience in the second café, just as users are more satisfied with a well-optimised, fast website.
