**1. Discuss the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating responsive web pages. Explain the significance of asynchronous programming in improving web page load times and user experience.**\
HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage, CSS controls the layout and visual styling, and JavaScript enables interactive behaviour. These three technologies work together to create responsive, interactive web applications.

Asynchronous programming is important in web development because it prevents the browser from freezing while tasks are running. In a synchronous model, operations such as API requests, file loading, or database queries stop the browser until they finish. This blocks the user interface and makes the page feel slow or unresponsive. Asynchronous code avoids this by allowing long-running processes to happen in the background. While the task continues, the browser remains active, allowing the user to click buttons, scroll, or type without interruption. This makes the webpage feel smoother and improves overall performance.

For responsiveness, HTML forms the foundation of the page’s structure across different screen sizes. CSS uses flexible measurements, grids, and media queries to adapt that structure across mobile, tablet, and desktop displays. JavaScript ensures that interactive elements adjust correctly as layouts change. For example, a navigation bar may be structured in HTML, transformed by CSS into a mobile-friendly dropdown, and controlled by JavaScript to open and close when tapped.

A common example of asynchronous behaviour is loading data from a remote server. The page layout can appear instantly, while JavaScript retrieves the data in the background. The user can continue interacting with the page instead of waiting for the request to complete. When the data arrives, the page updates without needing to reload.

Overall, asynchronous programming and responsive design work together to improve the user experience by keeping the interface fast, adaptable, and interactive.

**2. Explain how a slow page loading can impact user engagement and suggest web programming techniques to improve it.**\
Slow page loading reduces user engagement because it makes the website feel unresponsive and discourages users from staying on the page. When a page takes too long to load, users can become impatient and be more likely to leave before viewing the content. Having a slow page disrupts the browsing flow and experience, creates a sense of unreliability and lowers the time the user spends on the webpage. To enhance and improve this, developers can apply techniques such as minimising the file size of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, compressing images and using lazy loading so that images and videos only load when needed. For example, an online store with slow-loading product images may lose customers because many will exit the page before the images appear. However, if the site uses compressed images, the product information appears faster, and users are more likely to continue browsing. 

**3. Explain two benefits of HTML and CSS in web development. Provide an example of how they work together to structure and style a webpage.**\
HTML and CSS provide essential benefits in web development because HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS controls its visual presentation and layout. HTML makes development clearer and more organised by using semantic tags that define the purpose of content, such as headings, paragraphs and images. CSS improves efficiency by separating design from structure, allowing developers to adjust colours, spacing, typography and layout without altering the HTML itself. This separation leads to cleaner code, easier maintenance and faster styling changes across multiple pages. For example, HTML might be used to create a `<div>` containing a heading and a paragraph, while CSS targets those elements to style the heading with a larger font size and the paragraph with specific spacing and colour. This shows how HTML forms the foundation of the page and CSS enhances its appearance.

**4. Outline what is JavaScript and how it enhances the functionality of a webpage. Provide an example where JavaScript is used to validate user input on a web form.**\
JavaScript is a scripting language used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to webpages. It enhances functionality by allowing pages to respond to user actions, update content without reloading and handle tasks such as animations, form checks and menus.

An example is using JavaScript to validate a web form: when a user submits their details, a script can check whether the email field is filled in correctly or whether the password meets length requirements, displaying an alert if the input is invalid.

**5. Discuss the importance of optimising webpage load time for user experience. Provide three techniques to improve the loading speed of a website.**
Optimising web performance is essential because faster-loading websites improve user experience, reduce bounce rates, and increase engagement. Web developers can improve performance in several ways. Compression reduces the size of images, CSS and JavaScript files, allowing browsers to load content more quickly. Testing code ensures that scripts run efficiently and identifies slow functions using developer tools. Investing in server hardware ensures the site can handle multiple requests simultaneously, preventing delays caused by overloaded or underpowered servers. For example, an online store that compresses product images and minifies JavaScript will load faster for users, while developer tools can reveal which scripts are slowing the page. Hosting the site on high-performance servers ensures that even during peak traffic, pages remain responsive. This is like comparing two cafes: one has a slow barista and cramped space, causing long waits, while the other has a fast, efficient barista and enough tables for everyone. Customers stay longer and enjoy the experience in the second cafe, just as users are more satisfied with a well-optimised, fast website.

**6. Explain how the CSS Flexbox layout works. Provide a simple example of how you would use Flexbox to create a row of three equal-width boxes that adapt to the screen size. You may include a diagram and annotation.** \
CSS Flexbox is a layout system that allows items inside a container to be arranged in flexible rows or columns that automatically adjust to different screen sizes. Flexbox works by turning a parent element into a flex container, which then controls how its child elements, called flex items, stretch, shrink and align. It can distribute space evenly, make multiple items equal in width, and adapt layouts smoothly as the screen grows or shrinks. This makes it ideal for responsive design because developers do not need fixed widths. For example, to create a responsive row of three equal-width boxes, Flexbox would treat all three boxes as flex items. Each would share the available space evenly, so on a wide screen, they appear side by side with equal width and on a small screen, they shrink proportionally while remaining equal in size. This ensures the layout stays balanced without breaking or overlapping.

**7. Why is web accessibility important, and what are two best practices developers should follow to ensure their websites are accessible to all users? Provide examples for each best practice.**\
Web accessibility is important is it enables all users, including people with disabilities to access the website without barriers. Making a site accessible improves fairness, usability and the overall experience for each visitor. A best practice developers should follow is to provide text alternatives for non-visual content. This allows screen readers to describe images and icons to visually impaired users, as well as read out the passage. Another best practice would be to use colours that contrast, which would allow people to discern the text from the background better and wouldn’t have to strain their eyes as much. For example, A login form with correctly labelled input fields allows a screen reader to announce “Username, edit field” and “Password, edit field,” helping users understand what they need to type. Another would be using dark blue text on a white background to meet accessibility contrast standards, while avoiding low-contrast combinations like grey text on a white background.

**8. Discuss the importance of cross browser compatibility.**\
Cross-browser compatibility is important as it ensures that users have a consistent and reliable experience regardless of which browser they use, preventing issues like broken layouts or malfunctioning features. This enables the developer to reach a wider audience by supporting many different browsers and devices, including old versions and assistive technologies, which is essential for accessibility and user satisfaction. Furthermore, ensuring cross-browser compatibility improves reliability, prevents user frustration and helps maintain a positive user experience for everyone. This means that no users would be excluded due to technical issues. For example, a navigation menu might function correctly in Google Chrome but fail to open in Safari if the developer uses a feature that Safari does not support. By testing and adjusting the code using standardised methods or browser-compatible alternatives, the menu will behave consistently across browsers. Imagine visiting a website on one device and everything loads perfectly. Later, you open the same site on another browser, and suddenly buttons don’t work and the text overlaps. This inconsistency is confusing and discouraging. Cross-browser compatibility prevents these issues by ensuring every visitor, no matter what browser they use, gets the same smooth and reliable experience, just like how a well-designed bridge should support all types of vehicles, not only one.

**9. Explain the use of canvas tag in HTML design? Give an example.**\
The canvas tag in HTML is a special element that creates a space on a webpage where developers can draw and display graphics using JavaScript. It allows webpages to include custom visuals, such as shapes, animations, charts, and interactive graphics, that cannot be created with standard HTML elements alone. It provides a blank, rectangular area where developers can use JavaScript commands to render shapes, images, charts, game elements, etc. Unlike normal HTML elements, canvas does not display anything on its own, JavaScript is required to draw on it. This makes it useful for dynamic and real-time visual content that updates instantly without reloading the page. For example, a developer can use the canvas element to draw a circle that moves across the screen in an animation, or to generate a simple bar graph that updates as the user enters new data. The canvas acts as the drawing surface, while JavaScript controls what appears on it.


**10. Justify why the World Wide Web wasn't 'designed' to be 'secure' when it first emerged in the 1980s**\
The World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t designed to be secure in the 1980s because its creators built it for a small, trusted research company, not a global network where security threats are a major concern. When the web first emerged, it operated within closed groups, such as universities and government research labs. Users generally knew each other, and the system’s purpose was to share scientific information and documents, not to handle sensitive information like banking details or personal data. Because the environment was considered safe, early designers did not prioritise encryption, authentication or protection against malicious attacks. The web’s rapid expansion into commercial and public use in the 1990s made these security limitations clear, but by then, the foundations were already built without strong protection. For example, early web protocols such as HTTP originally sent information in plain text with no encryption because the developers never expected hostile users to intercept the data. Only later did technologies like HTTPS have to be added to protect privacy and secure online transactions. It is like building a small community library where everyone knows each other, so there are no locks on the doors or cameras inside. When the library suddenly becomes a major public centre visited by thousands of unknown people, the lack of security becomes a serious problem. Similarly, the web grew far beyond what its original designers anticipated, exposing the gaps left by its early trust-based design.
