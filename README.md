# Yr12AssessmentTask-1
## Programming For The Web
**Outcomes to be Assessed (Syllabus outcomes being assessed by task)**\
SE-12-01: Investigates and applies appropriate development methodologies to solve software-related problems.
SE-12-02: Designs and develops software solutions using appropriate data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts.
SE-12-04: Demonstrates understanding of web-based technologies and their applications.
SE-12-07: Demonstrates understanding of security issues in software development and how to safeguard software systems.
SE-12-08: Develops and tests software that addresses both user needs and system requirements.
SE-12-09: Communicates software concepts and solutions through appropriate documentation and diagrams.

**Task Description (What you are to do)**\
This assessment task is designed to evaluate your understanding and application of key concepts from the NSW Software Engineering syllabus.

It will assess your ability to develop secure software solutions, demonstrate proficiency in web development, and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.

You are required to submit both a theoretical (Part A) written response (Part B) and a practical coding component.

**Part A: Theoretical Response (30 Marks)**\
Short Answer Questions
Word Limit for each of these questions is 300. These questions are to be answered using HSC verbs and the
recommended structure.

**Part B: Practical Application (70 Marks)**\
For each of these tasks, you need to develop full functional examples and create a quality screencast of your
solution.
Each example must be developed and presented as ‘code’ and produced as a screen recording in which you:
- Demonstrate your understanding of the code by demonstrating its operation.
- Use technical language where relevant to identify key elements
- Justify the benefits and issues of developing secure solutions using hypothetical examples relevant to your demonstration.
